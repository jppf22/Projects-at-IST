# Logic For Programming - Final Project

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a .pl file (in this case, 'proj.pl') that given two "databases": 

- **'dados.pl'**: stored the time data of the schedules, shifts, and classes for each bachelor's and master's program in TÃ©cnico

- **'keywords.pl**: stored the names and numbering of each 'classroom' where it was possible to have classes, as well as the names for the bachelor's and master's.

Would be able to respond to different prompts regarding "time information", such as: "Which shifts have class at 8:00am?", "Which classes conflict between x and y hours?", "How does the duration of a semester evolve for all programmes?".
