# Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms

Each project for this course consisted of creating novel algorithms to solve problems in the following domains:
- **P1: Dynamic Programming** -> Finding maximum return value obtained from vertically and horizontally cutting a steel sheet into different formats requested by patients  
- **P2: Graphs** -> Finding the maximum number of "jumps" (infections) a disease can do in a certain social network (graph representing people as nodes and connections between people as edges)
- **P3: Linear Programming** -> Maximum daily profit from a toy factory given constraints relating to different types of toys and special deals, maximum number of toys to be produced per day, profit from each toy type and special deal and production capacity for each toy type and special deal (considering that a special deal is formed by any 3 toys). 

On each folder both the problem statement and our report is available (in portuguese), as well as the presented code solution.

> NOTE: even though this is the C++ folder, project 3 was done in Python, due to the library it is required to use. To ensure only 1 folder per course is created, it will stay here.
