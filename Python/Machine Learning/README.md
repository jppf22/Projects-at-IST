# Machine Learning Projects

In each folder, is one of the 4 "Homeworks" (<i>more like mini-projects</i>) from TÃ©cnico's ML course.

Each of these combines a mathematical pen&paper component and a coding component, done on Jupyter Notebooks with ML libraries (`scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, scipy` and others).

The `main.pdf` file in each one shows the final report, done in `latex`, according to required specifications, mostly containing explanations of results, comparisons and reasoning behind approaches.
