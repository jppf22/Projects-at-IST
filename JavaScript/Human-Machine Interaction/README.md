# Human-Machine Interaction

On this course, focused on learning design principles and rules for creation of interactive devices and software, there were two projects, both focused on UX optimisation:
- Redesigning an old quizzes platform according to learnt standards. The Figma mockup is available [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/GYORqF2nGEgNCmYvzcvTzE/PAF?node-id=20-3287&starting-point-node-id=20%3A3287&t=EDUPKhvBysVSDciS-1)
- Improve player times on an online p5.js geography quiz game, by applying [Usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and [UX laws](https://lawsofux.com/). Store player automatic player metrics on a Google Firebase database. You can try it [here](https://editor.p5js.org/jppf22/full/K368SNDiA)
