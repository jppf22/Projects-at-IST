# Databases

Project consisted mostly on creation of a healthcare database system, creating SQL queries for specific objectives and implement a RESTful API capable of interacting with the database through 5 simple HTTP requests: list available doctor slots, list clinic specialities, list clinics, schedule and cancelation of appointments.

The PostgresSQL server and its dependencies ran on a docker container provided for the class. The RESTful API was tested on Bruno, and the backend flask implementation can be seen on app.py.
